python oop
class: variables methods
methods: give the class itself as the first argument hence every method has self as the first argument
constructor :: __init__(self) executed when the class instance is created
def __init__ (self,name:str,price:float...) --- for providing datatype if the input
assert == to run validations on input in construction 
assert conditions, error_string(not nessasary)
