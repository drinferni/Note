#opertator in a Macro is use to convert the parameter in the macro as string. EG -
	#define STR(data) #data
	STR(ansh)
will generate
	"ansh"
	The only difference between a parameterized macro and one without parameters
is the parentheses immediately following the macro name
	 enum variables cannot be used to index an array. The following will result in an error:
new() operator (variable=new <type>[value]: The new operator is used to allocate memory for an object on the heap and construct the object.
delete operator (del ptr) : The delete operator is used to deallocate the memory previously allocated by new and destroy the object.
