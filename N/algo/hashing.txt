hashing 

hashing function == 
	-- mod method = A prime not too close to an exact power of 2 is often good choice for table_size.
	-- multiplication method = Suppose that the word size of the machine is w bits and that key fits into a single word.
We restrict c to be a fraction of the form s / (2w), where s is an integer in the range 0 < s < 2w. 
	--  multiplication method = 
types of hashing
	-- division method
	-- mid aquare method
	-- folding method
	-- multiplication method
